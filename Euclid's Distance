# Given a table HOUSES, find the euclidean distance between points with the largest X and Y coordinate, and the points with the smallest X and Y coordinate.

#  The Euclidean Distance between 2 points P(x1, y1) and Q(x2, y2) is defined as: sqrt((x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).

SELECT
 SQRT((MAX(XCoordinate) - MIN(XCoordinate)) * (MAX(XCoordinate) - MIN(XCoordinate)) + (MAX(YCoordinate) - MIN(YCoordinate)) * (MAX(YCoordinate) - MIN(YCoordinate))) as A 
FROM HOUSES
